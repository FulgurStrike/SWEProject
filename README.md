## Parking Management System
  Change Log:
  * First rendition of the backend has been made with simple test index page

## Dev instructions
* When editing any code, frontend or backend these two scripts should be running in two separate terminals:

```bash
npm run dev <- This will run nodemon script so you can see changes

npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./public/input.css -o ./public/output.css --watch <- Auto compiles css changes so you can see them update in real time
```
