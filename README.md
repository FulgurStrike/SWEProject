## Parking Management System
  Change Log:
  * First rendition of the backend has been made with simple test index page

## Dev instructions
* When editing any code, frontend or backend these two scripts should be running in two separate terminals:

```bash
npm run dev <- This will run nodemon script so you can see changes

npm run compileCss <- Compiles css with a watcher flag to see real time changes
```
